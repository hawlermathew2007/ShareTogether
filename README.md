Another serious website that I am working on, and this time, it is MERN stack! From this I tended to simulate a social media (not a real one, because I don't have money to extend my database sobs). The theme is like the combination between Twitter (not X) and Facebook. The design is pretty nice at least to me. You Geeks can git clone it and enjoy my temporary project!
